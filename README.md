# Neural_Network

## Context
A foundation, Alphabet Soup, needs help predicting where to make investments. 

## Goal
I'm creating a binary classifier that is capable of predicitng whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. The module content utilized Jupyter notebooks, however Tensorflow didn't work on my Mac so I utilized Google Colab. 

## Results
In *Data Preprocessing*, the column IS SUCCESSFUL is the target for the model, as it has binary data that can tell us whether the charity donation was used as intended. The columns APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS AND ASK_AMT are the model features. 

In *Compiling and Training the Model*, the model accuracy is under 75%, which does not imply a satisfactory performance.
